## Sub Topics

Important:

Customers must purchase (or own) App Points for MAS prior to (or in conjunction with) ordering the IBM Managed Service. The managed service provides IBM Cloud based hosting, product installation, operation, maintenance and support for MAS.

The provisioning process is invoked when a client has placed an order using MAS-MS part numbers. There are three (3) part numbers:

D02QTZX - Capacity
D02QUZX - Data
D02QWZX - VPC (Virtual Processor Core)

For details, per see Part Numbers and Order consideration

Each client is provisioned in an environment that is separate and distinct from other clients.  The provisioning is done to meet the specific customer requirements for a specific order.  This means there is no pre-provisioning done and client environment provisioning begins when an order is placed. 

The provisioning process has several steps, most of them automated, but some that require a manual update(s) to complete.  The time frame to complete a new provisioning will depend on several factors including:
 
- the size of the order
- the order complexity
- the number of orders in the queue ahead of the order

In general, allow for at least 1 week for provisioning to be completed.

The provisioning itself can be broken down into a number of steps:
 
- Order validation
- Information gathering
- Initial provisioning of MAS base environment
- Provisioning of the individual MAS products the clients has requested
- Internal IBM verification of the provisioned environments
- Welcome letter sent to the client / designated contacts indicating provisioning is complete
