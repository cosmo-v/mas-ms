## Database Support and Access
{: #database-support}

IBM Maximo Application Suite Managed Services supports DB2 as the database for the Suite.  Clients who wish to directly access their data can with the following restrictions or procedures:

* Direct access to the production database is not allowed.  If a client wishes to access production data, they must order a data replica and a read only user can be created against this replica.  This replica is near real time so it will mirror the production data.

* Read only users can be requested for non-productin databases.

* Read / Write users can be requested for development databases.

A support ticket must be submitted listing the names and emails of the users needing access.  
One ticket is required for each database.

All users created is the client responsibility to ensure once access is no longer required a support ticket created to remove that access.
